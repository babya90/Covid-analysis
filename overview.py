    st.write('''COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and quickly developed into a global pandemic. 
It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and can also be 
transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face. The virus can lead to a wide range of symptoms, 
from mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and death, with older adults and those with underlying health conditions
at higher risk of severe outcomes.\n
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global cooperation, scientific research, 
and public health infrastructure in responding to emerging infectious diseases. 
It has also spurred innovation in areas such as vaccine development, telemedicine, and remote work. 
As the world continues to navigate the challenges posed by COVID-19, collaboration, resilience, and adaptability will be essential in overcoming this unprecedented crisis.
